/**
 * Test workflow demonstrating executable actions.
 *
 * Actions:
 * - send: Send data to a registered action handler (HTTP, messaging, events)
 * - execute: Run a command by ID (from commands.yaml)
 *
 * Security: Execute commands are NOT defined in the workflow.
 * They are referenced by ID and resolved from commands.yaml at runtime.
