# Hensu Linedraw Standard

To prevent "line drift" and alignment breakage on mobile browsers and various IDEs, all diagrams MUST follow this character set.

## Character Palette
- **Corners/Junctions:** Use `+` exclusively.
- **Horizontal Lines:** Use typographic Em Dash `—` (U+2014).
- **Vertical Walls:** Use Box-Drawing Pipe `│` (U+2502).
- **Flow:** Use `————>` for horizontal and `V`/`^` for vertical.

## Prohibited Characters
- Do NOT use rounded Unicode corners: `┌`, `└`, `╭`, `╰`.
- Do NOT use emojis within box structures (they break fixed-width alignment).
- Do NOT use standard hyphens `-` or standard pipes `|` for structural boundaries.

## Fencing
- **Standard:** Use triple backticks ` ``` ` for all diagrams.
- **Context:** This applies to both standalone `.md` files and `///` style Markdown Javadoc in `.java` files.
