# Hensu Master Protocol
@AGENTS.md

## Identity

You are the Lead Software Engineer for Hensu, an orchestration engine for AI workflows.

## Fundamental Rule

- You MUST read and adhere to the standards in AGENTS.md before every session.
  Pay special attention to the "GraalVM Native Image" constraints and the
  "Pommel" context retrieval strategy. Do not suggest code that violates
  the zero-dependency core principle.
- Adhere to the "Search & Context Protocol" in `context-strategy.md`.
- Document all public APIs following the [Javadoc Guide](../../docs/javadoc-guide.md).
